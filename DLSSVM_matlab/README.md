Object Tracking via Dual Linear Structured SVM and Explicit Feature Map
===============================================================

This folder implemented by Jifeng Ning, Jimei Yang, Shaojie Jiang, Lei Zhang and Ming-Hsuan Yang. “Object Tracking via Dual Linear Structured SVM and Explicit Feature Map”, 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4266-4274, Las Vegas, USA, 2016.[Website](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/DLSSVM/DLSSVM.htm)



Robust Tracking via Multiple Experts using Entropy Minimization
===============================================================

This folder also includes an implementation of the tracking algorithm described in "MEEM: Robust Tracking via Multiple Experts using Entropy Minimization" by Jianming Zhang, Shugao Ma, Stan Sclaroff. The implementation is based on the [original implementation](http://cs-people.bu.edu/jmzhang/MEEM/MEEM.html) retrieved in October 2016.
